Primarily a metal-core band, Architects are also proficient in progressive metal, mathcore and post-hardcore genres.</p>\r\n<p>The past decade of their existence saw the release of 5 albums and one split up with <em>Dead Swans,&nbsp;</em>with their sixth album recently released. They are all set to release a film &ndash; <em>One Hundred Days: The Story of Architects Almost World Tour- </em>about the 100 day tour for which funding was completely raised from loyal fans. The band has played in some of the biggest festivals in the world, like Download, Summer Breeze, Resurrection Fest, Grasspop Metal Meeting, Sonisphere Festival, and Hellfest, each boasting five-figure audiences, and has toured in some of the most coveted tours like the Vans Wraped Tour, with some of the biggest names in the metal world like Deftones, August Burns Red, Enter Shikari, Whitechapel, and All That Remains, to name but a few.</p>\r\n<p>Referred to as \"pumped with both controlled rage and unhindered heart, accessible and ambitious, aggressive and beautiful\", Architects have performed at various places all over the world, including America, Canada, Germany, England, Malaysia, Philippines and other countries of Europe, Australia and Asia, making the crowd go berserk in every performance.

This will be one great show for not just metal lovers, but for anyone who appreciate some good music!</p>\r\n<p>Classical Night:</p>\r\n<p>The prodigal Violin duo, fondly addressed as Ganesh-Kumaresh, took to the violin like a fish to water. Having delivered over a hundred performances before the tender age of ten, they moved on from strength to strength, emerging as one of the finest violinists of today. Popularly recognized for their refreshingly entertaining and interactive concerts, Ganesh-Kumaresh will feature in Classical Night, Saarang 2014 - treating the audience to an evening of pure delight and magic.</p>\r\n<p><span>Sonal Mansingh, a recipient of Padma Vibhushan, is one of the most eminent Odissi dancers of today, apart from being proficient in various other dance forms.
