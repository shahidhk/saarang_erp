<p>Greetings from the Saarang organizing committee!&nbsp;Thank you for registering for Saarang! We will be sending out updates regarding some of our new events over the next few days, and this mail is about our&nbsp;exciting new event called&nbsp;<strong>Young Reporter</strong>.Read on for more!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to tell the nation what it really wants to know? Do you think you can cut the crap and make an impact? Have you always been fascinated by the world of reporting? Then here's your chance!</p>
<p>Media has a significant impact on our lives - be it the sensationalised Aarushi Talwar murder case or the Ashok Ganguly allegations. Media was meant to bring to the people a fair and just assessment of happenings across the globe. It has the power to influence policies, pressurize Government policies and start revolutions. But is this enormous power being used judiciously?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saarang in association with The Times of India present to you Young Reporters! A unique contest to test the reporter in you. Go out onto the LOC or into remote villages of Tamil Nadu to bring to the people THE scoop of the decade. In the most ethical way possible, of course!</p>
