Hello, 

Greetings from Saarang 2014.

It is great to see that you have registered for Saarang. We, at Saarang, are pleased to host you during your stay here at IIT Madras. As always, we strive hard to ensure that your stay here is gratifying and memorable. It gives us great pleasure to bring you the news that we have opened the Accommodation Portal (http://saarang.org/2014/main/#accommodation). You can register at the portal and we will get back to you as soon as your accommodation is confirmed.

'The early bird gets the worm.'

So please make sure that you register at the earliest and give us a chance to host you at this year's Grand Carnival.

P.S - Kindly note that your registration alone doesn't guarantee your accomodation. All further details will be conveyed to you by mail after you register.

Wishing you a happy Saarang,
